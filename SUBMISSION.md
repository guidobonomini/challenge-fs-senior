### 4. Docker Requirements (Mandatory)

Your submission **MUST** include working Docker configuration:

#### Required Files:
- `docker-compose.yml` - for local development
- `Dockerfile` in backend directory
- `Dockerfile` in frontend directory
- `.env.example` - with all required environment variables

#### Docker Setup Must:
- Start entire application with `docker-compose up`
- Include all services (frontend, backend, database, cache)
- Properly configure networking between containers
- Include persistent volumes for database
- Provide clear port mapping documentation
- Include health checks for services

#### Example docker-compose.yml structure:
```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - database
      - redis
    
  database:
    image: postgres:15
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
```

### 5. Live Demo (Required)
Deploy your application to a free hosting service:

**Recommended Platforms:**
- **Full-stack**: Railway, Render, Fly.io
- **Frontend**: Vercel, Netlify
- **Backend**: Heroku, Railway, Render
- **Database**: Heroku Postgres, PlanetScale, Supabase, Railway

**Demo Requirements:**
- Application must be fully functional
- Include sample data for testing
- Provide test credentials for different user roles
- Ensure all core features are working

### 6. Testing Requirements

Your submission should include:

#### Backend Tests:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Authentication/authorization tests
- Database operation tests

#### Frontend Tests:
- Component unit tests
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests for critical paths

#### Test Documentation:

- How to run tests in Docker
- Test coverage reports
- CI/CD pipeline setup (bonus)

### 7. Final Submission Checklist

Before submitting, ensure you have:

- [ ] Working Docker setup (`docker-compose up` works)
- [ ] Complete SOLUTION.md documentation
- [ ] Live demo deployed and accessible
- [ ] Test credentials provided
- [ ] All core features implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Clean commit history with meaningful messages

### 8. Submission Process

When ready to submit:

1. **Final Push**: Ensure all code is pushed to your fork
2. **Verify Demo**: Double-check your live demo is working
3. **Test Docker**: Verify `docker-compose up` works on a fresh clone
4. **Review Documentation**: Ensure SOLUTION.md is complete
5. **Submit**: Send us the following information:

```
Repository: <link-to-your-fork>

## Evaluation Timeline
- We'll review your submission within 3-5 business days
- You may be invited for a technical discussion about your solution
- We'll provide feedback regardless of the outcome

## Questions?
- Create an issue in this repository for technical questions about requirements
- Email [contact-email] for process-related questions

## Tips for Success

### Development Strategy:
- **Start with MVP**: Get basic CRUD operations working first
- **Docker Early**: Set up Docker configuration early in development
- **Test as You Go**: Write tests alongside features, don't leave until the end
- **Document Continuously**: Update SOLUTION.md as you build
- **Commit Frequently**: Show your development process with clear commit messages

### Architecture Focus:
- **Security First**: Implement authentication/authorization early
- **Database Design**: Spend time on proper schema design
- **API Design**: Follow RESTful principles and proper status codes
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
- **Performance**: Consider caching, pagination, and optimization

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Don't skip Docker setup - it's mandatory
- Don't leave documentation until the end
- Don't ignore error handling and edge cases
- Don't skip tests - they're part of the evaluation
- Don't deploy broken features - better to have fewer working features

### What We're Looking For:
- **Senior-level thinking**: Architecture decisions, trade-offs, scalability considerations
- **Code quality**: Clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- **Full-stack competence**: Strong skills across the entire stack
- **Production readiness**: Security, testing, deployment, monitoring
- **Problem-solving**: How you handle complex requirements and constraints

Good luck! We're excited to see your solution and learn about your approach to building scalable applications.

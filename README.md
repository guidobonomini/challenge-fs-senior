```

### Docker Requirements

### Local Development Setup
Your solution **must** include Docker configuration for easy local setup:

```bash
# Should work out of the box
git clone <your-fork>
cd <your-fork>
docker-compose up
```

### Required Docker Files
- **docker-compose.yml**: For local development environment
- **docker-compose.prod.yml**: For production deployment (optional)
- **Backend Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build for your chosen stack (Node.js/Python/Go)
- **Frontend Dockerfile**: Optimized build for React/Vue/Angular frontend
- **Environment Variables**: Properly configured for different environments

### Container Requirements
- **Frontend Container**: Serve built static files or run dev server
- **Backend Container**: API server with proper health checks
- **Database Container**: PostgreSQL/MySQL with persistent volumes
- **Redis Container**: For caching and session management
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx container for routing (bonus points)

All containers should start with a single `docker-compose up` command and be accessible via localhost with clear port documentation.

## Sample User Stories

**Technology Choice**: You can use **Node.js**, **Python**, or **Go** for the backend, and any modern frontend framework. The focus is on demonstrating senior-level problem-solving, architecture skills, and attention to detail. Quality over quantity - a well-implemented subset is better than a poorly executed full feature set.
